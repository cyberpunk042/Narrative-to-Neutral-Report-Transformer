"""
JSON Instruct Backend — Placeholder for small instruction model.

Will implement structured extraction via JSON-only instruction model.

Per LLM policy:
- Strict structured outputs only (JSON schema enforced)
- Structure suggester, never authority
- All outputs validated and rejectable
"""

# TODO: Implement when NLP dependencies are added
# This will use a small instruction-tuned model (e.g., Flan-T5-small, Phi-3-mini)
# with strict JSON schema enforcement
