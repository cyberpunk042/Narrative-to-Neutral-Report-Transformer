# Golden test data directory
# 
# Golden tests lock behavior against known-good outputs.
# Each test case includes input and expected IR output.
#
# To add a new golden test:
# 1. Create a YAML file with input text
# 2. Run transformation
# 3. Review and approve output
# 4. Save approved IR as expected output
