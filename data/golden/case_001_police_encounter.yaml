# Golden Test Case 001: Basic Police Encounter
# This test locks the expected transformation behavior

input: |
  I was walking home around 11 PM when a police officer stopped me.
  He said I looked suspicious.
  He clearly wanted to intimidate me, standing way too close and staring at me.
  He intentionally blocked my path.
  After 20 minutes he let me go without any explanation.
