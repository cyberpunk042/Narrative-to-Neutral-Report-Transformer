      I was pulled over for a broken taillight. The cop approached my window 
      screaming at me to get out. Before I could even unbuckle my seatbelt, 
      he yanked the door open, grabbed me by my shirt collar, and threw me 
      face-first onto the asphalt. My face hit the ground hard. I felt my 
      teeth cut into my lip. Blood started pooling under my face. He put 
      his knee in my back and wrenched my arms behind me. I kept saying 
      "I'm not resisting, I'm not resisting" but he just kept pressing 
      harder. My glasses were broken on the ground next to me.

      I was already in handcuffs, sitting on the curb. I asked why I was 
      being detained and the officer told me to shut up. I asked again, 
      because I have a right to know. He walked over, grabbed my hair, 
      pulled my head back, and punched me in the face. My nose started 
      bleeding immediately. He said "That's for not shutting up when I 
      told you." There were three other officers there. None of them 
      did anything. I have it on video from my dashcam.

      He came up behind me and put his arm around my neck. Not like a 
      headlock, but directly on my throat. I immediately couldn't breathe. 
      I tried to say "I can't breathe" but nothing came out. My vision 
      started going dark around the edges. I grabbed at his arm trying to 
      get air. That's when they said I was "actively resisting." I was 
      trying not to die. The whole thing lasted maybe 30 seconds but it 
      felt like forever. When he finally let go I collapsed and vomited. 
      I had bruises on my neck for two weeks.

      I was asleep at 3 AM when I heard my front door explode. They came 
      in screaming with flashlights and guns. I had no idea what was 
      happening. I thought it was a home invasion. They threw me out of 
      bed onto the floor and zip-tied my hands. My girlfriend was screaming. 
      They had her face-down on the hallway floor in her underwear. It 
      took them 20 minutes to figure out they had the wrong apartment. 
      The guy they wanted lived two floors up. They just left. Didn't 
      apologize. Didn't fix my door. I couldn't sleep for months.

      The dog walked around my car twice and didn't react to anything. 
      Then the handler walked him past the driver door again and I saw 
      him tap his leg. The dog sat down. The handler said "that's an 
      alert." I said "he didn't alert until you tapped your leg." The 
      officer told me to shut up or I'd be arrested for obstruction. 
      They searched my entire car for 45 minutes. Found nothing. But now 
      I have a "K9 alert" on my record and I got a ticket for expired 
      registration which wasn't even why they stopped me.

      I was walking home from work at 11 PM. I work night shift at the 
      hospital, still had my scrubs on. Two cops pulled up and asked me 
      what I was doing in "this neighborhood." I said I live here. They 
      asked for ID. I asked if I was being detained. They said they had 
      reports of a burglary. I'm a 45-year-old nurse walking home with 
      a backpack. They ran my ID for 20 minutes while I stood there. 
      Then they said I could go. No apology. This was the fourth time 
      this year.

      They said they stopped me because I "didn't signal long enough" 
      before changing lanes. Then they asked if there were drugs or 
      weapons in the car. Then they asked where I was coming from and 
      where I was going. Then they asked whose car it was. It's my car. 
      I've owned it for 6 years. Then they asked if I'd consent to a 
      search. I said no. Then they made me wait 45 minutes for a K9 
      unit. I was going to pick up my daughter from dance class. She 
      waited alone in the parking lot.

      He had his hand on his gun the entire time. When I reached for my 
      registration in the glove box, he screamed "DON'T FUCKING MOVE" 
      and drew his weapon. He pointed it at my head and said "If you 
      move again I will blow your fucking brains out, do you understand 
      me?" I was shaking so hard I couldn't respond. He kept screaming 
      "DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME" over and over. I finally managed to say 
      yes. My registration was in the glove box where he told me to 
      put my hands.

      I was sitting in my car in a parking lot eating lunch. The cop 
      pulled up behind me, got out, and approached my window. Before 
      I could even roll it down he started banging on the glass and 
      screaming this guttural yell - not words, just this aggressive 
      war-cry sound. Like he was trying to intimidate me before 
      anything even happened. I opened the door with my hands up and 
      he immediately grabbed my wrist and twisted it behind my back.

      He swung at me with his baton and I flinched back. That's it. I 
      didn't touch him, didn't swing back, just instinctively moved 
      away from something coming at my face. They charged me with 
      resisting arrest with violence. The DA dropped it but I still 
      lost my job because I was arrested. The bodycam footage shows 
      exactly what happened but it took 14 months to get it. By then 
      the damage was done.

      He punched me in the stomach while I was cuffed. I doubled over 
      and stumbled into him. He then accused me of assaulting an officer. 
      His report says I "lunged aggressively" at him. I was vomiting from 
      getting hit in the stomach. How is that an aggressive lunge? He 
      charged me with assault on a peace officer. I faced 5 years. The 
      charges were dropped when a witness came forward with cell phone 
      video.

      I kept telling them I needed a doctor. My ribs hurt so bad I 
      couldn't breathe deep. I was spitting blood. They left me in the 
      holding cell for 8 hours. When I finally got to the hospital, 
      they found two cracked ribs and a punctured lung. The doctors 
      asked what happened and the officers told them I "fell during 
      arrest." I tried to tell them the truth but the cops stayed in 
      the room the whole time. I was afraid to say anything.

      I told him the cuffs were too tight. He said "they're supposed 
      to hurt." I asked him at least three more times over the next 
      hour. Each time he ignored me or laughed. By the time they took 
      them off my hands were blue and I couldn't feel my fingers. I 
      still can't feel two fingers on my right hand. The nerve damage 
      is permanent according to my doctor.

      his partner's camera. Both cameras malfunctioned at the exact

      My mom called for a wellness check because she couldn't reach me.

      to open up. I opened it confused and half-asleep. They immediately 
      grabbed me, threw me against the wall, and cuffed me in my own 
      apartment. They searched my place without asking. One of them 
      broke my laptop "checking for weapons." They were there for an

      I was having a panic attack. My neighbor called 911 thinking I

      They pointed guns at me while I was hyperventilating on my kitchen 
      floor. One of them kept yelling "calm down" which made it worse. 
      I couldn't respond, I couldn't breathe. They tackled me and held 
      me down. I was involuntarily committed for 72 hours. They wrote 
      that I was "aggressive and non-compliant." I was having a panic
