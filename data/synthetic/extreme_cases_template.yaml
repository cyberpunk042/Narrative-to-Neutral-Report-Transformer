# EXTREME CASES - Real-World Police Encounter Narratives
#
# These are templates for REAL scenarios. 
# Fill in the [PLACEHOLDER] sections with authentic language.
# The transformation system needs to handle the raw truth.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Replace [DESCRIBE_...] with raw, unfiltered narrative
# 2. Keep the structure (input/expected_behavior/expected_preserved)
# 3. Run: nnrt transform "your text" to test
#
# Remember: The goal is NEUTRAL output, not sanitized silence.
# Facts must survive. Only bias/conclusions should transform.
