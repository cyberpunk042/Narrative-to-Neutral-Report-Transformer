  text: |
    I was walking home around 11 PM when a police car pulled up next to me.
    The officer got out and immediately asked me where I was going.
    I told him I was going home. He said I looked "suspicious" and asked for ID.
    I didn't have my wallet so I couldn't show ID.
    He made me sit on the curb for about 20 minutes while he ran my name.
    Eventually he let me go without any explanation.

  This is a synthetic example for testing segmentation and span tagging.
  Real narratives would be more complex and less well-formed.
