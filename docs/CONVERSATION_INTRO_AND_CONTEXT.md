# NNRT — Conversation Introduction & Context Guide

This document is intended to be shared or referenced **at the start of any new discussion** about NNRT.

Its purpose is to quickly establish context, boundaries, and direction — without re-explaining the entire project.

---

## 1. What NNRT Is (Short)

NNRT (Narrative-to-Neutral Report Transformer) is a **language transformation tool**.

It converts raw first-person narratives into **neutral, non-accusatory, procedurally safe** representations.

NNRT is a **tool**, not a platform.

---

## 2. What NNRT Is Not (Short)

NNRT is **not**:

* A reporting or submission system
* A publishing platform
* A truth or verification engine
* A judgment, scoring, or accountability system

If a discussion assumes any of the above, it is out of scope.

---

## 3. Core Principles

All discussions and decisions must respect these principles:

* **Process over judgment** — no conclusions or blame
* **Experience over accusation** — first-person, observable facts only
* **Determinism and transparency** — no opaque behavior
* **Minimal surface area** — no storage, hosting, or aggregation
* **Ethical restraint** — endurance over immediacy

These principles are non-negotiable.

---

## 4. Key Documents (Read First)

For full context, the following files define the project:

* `README.md`
  High-level description of NNRT, its purpose, and design philosophy.

* `SCOPE_AND_ETHICS.md`
  Hard boundaries, ethical constraints, and non-goals.

* `PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_PLANNING.md`
  How milestones, features, analysis, and plans are structured.

* `LICENSE`
  Legal posture and disclaimers.

Any proposal that conflicts with these documents must be reconsidered or rejected.

---

## 5. How Work Is Structured

NNRT development follows this order:

1. **Milestone definition**
2. **Milestone document**
3. **Feature documents (when warranted)**
4. **Analysis documents (when risk or ambiguity exists)**
5. **Planning documents**
6. **Code (last)**

Skipping steps is discouraged.

---

## 6. How to Contribute to a Discussion

When proposing an idea, try to state:

* Which milestone it belongs to
* Whether it affects scope or ethics
* Whether it introduces new transformation logic
* What problem it solves

Unscoped ideas are welcome, but they must be framed as questions, not directives.

---

## 7. Default Assumptions

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, assume:

* Local, offline usage
* Synthetic or fictional examples only
* No persistence of input data
* No learning or adaptive behavior

---

## Closing Note

NNRT is intentionally careful.

This guide exists so that each new conversation can start **aligned**, focused, and productive — without needing to rediscover the project’s foundations.

If something feels unclear or constrained, that is a signal to revisit the documents, not bypass them.
